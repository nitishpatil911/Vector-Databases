# Vector Databases

A Vector Database is a specialized database designed to store, index, and search high-dimensional vectors (embeddings).
These vectors represent unstructured data — like text, images, or audio — in numerical form, allowing semantic search, recommendation systems, and AI-powered retrieval.

When you convert data (text, image, video, etc.) into embeddings using a model (like OpenAI’s, Hugging Face’s, or Sentence Transformers), each piece of data becomes a vector in a high-dimensional space.
The vector database helps efficiently:

Store millions (or billions) of embeddings

Perform similarity searches (using cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, etc.)

Scale to handle real-time retrieval for large AI applications.

How It Works

Data Ingestion: Input text, image, etc.

Embedding Generation: Use an embedding model (like text-embedding-ada-002) to convert it into a dense numerical vector.

Storage in Vector DB: The embeddings are stored as high-dimensional points.

Similarity Search: When a query comes, it’s converted to an embedding and compared with stored embeddings using distance metrics.

Popular Vector Databases

Common Use Cases

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Combine LLMs with relevant document retrieval

Semantic Search: Search by meaning rather than keywords

Recommendation Systems: Find similar products, images, or content

Fraud Detection: Identify similar patterns in transactions

Image/Audio Retrieval: Find visually or aurally similar items
